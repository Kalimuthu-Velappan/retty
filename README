This README file is just a stub. You will find some real information in the
manpage included with this package.

Warning:
--------

This program is for x86 Linux only. Don't run it on any other OS or
any other architecture, or it _WILL_ crash your applications. It should
run well on 32bit distributions running on amd64, but definitely not 64bit
distributions.

Build:
------

	make

Usage:
------

	man ./retty.1

If you want to just run application detached only for attaching it with
retty in future, you might find the blindtty tool useful, especially
in connection with the setsid command which will do the detach part:

	setsid blindtty <some command with arguments and so on>
